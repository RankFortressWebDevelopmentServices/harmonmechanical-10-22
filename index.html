                            Every year, home fires claim the lives of over 2,500 Americans and injure another 12,600, according to the National Fire Protection Association. Many of these fires are caused by malfunctioning or poorly maintained heating equipment. That’s why it’s essential to have your furnace checked and serviced by a professional every year. A trained technician will inspect your furnace for signs of wear and tear and repair or replace any parts that are not up to code. This can help keep your family safe from fire hazards and also prevent costly repairs down the road. In addition, regular maintenance can improve the efficiency of your furnace, saving you money on your energy bills, so if you want to keep your family safe and save money, schedule annual heating maintenance for your home.

                            <a href="https://harmonmechanical.com/air-conditioning-auburn/ac-installation/">Heating systems</a> are one of the most expensive appliances in your home, so it makes sense to do everything you can to extend their lifespan. One of the best ways to do this is to schedule heating maintenance regularly. Like a car, your heating system needs regular check-ups and tune-ups to keep it running correctly. A trained technician will clean and lubricate all the moving parts, check for gas or water leaks, and ensure the system operates efficiently. This not only helps to prevent unexpected repairs, but it can also help reduce your energy bills. In addition, regular maintenance can help identify potential problems before they cause significant damage.

                        <p>
                            If you have a furnace, it’s recommended to be serviced annually. For boilers, servicing is generally required every two years. Some service contracts include annual maintenance at no extra charge, so ask about this when shopping for a new heating system.

                    Heating systems are a necessary part of daily life for many people, but they can also be a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, according to the EPA, space heating accounts for about 15% of all residential energy use in the United States. The good news is that there are several things you can do to make your heating system more efficient and reduce your greenhouse gas emissions. One of the most important things you can do is maintain regular maintenance. This includes replacing old or damaged parts, cleaning filters, and ensuring the system is calibrated correctly. You should also ensure that your home is insulated to minimize heat loss. Finally, consider investing in a more efficient heating system. High-efficiency systems are available for gas and oil furnaces and can significantly reduce your greenhouse gas emissions.
